Dogs. They are adorable. They are cute and cuddly and bring so much joy to our lives. 

Take my dog, Chihu - oh, I adore her. I love spending time with her. 

I’m not writing this to convince you to get a dog for yourself. What I’m proposing, however, is that we should all be more like dogs!
Yes, I know, it’s unusual but hear me out.
- **Calmness**
    Dogs are calm (*for the most part)*. They bring a sense of stillness in you when they are around. There is a certain peace you feel in their presence. Right now, when I'm writing this, she sits beside me, calm and composed. Such a positive energy
  <br/>
- **Satisfaction with very little**
  They are happy with very little. You give them their food, spoil them with a few treats and spend some time with them, and they couldn’t be happier! Who would have thought a tiny piece of carrot could be so satisfying?
  
  It doesn’t take much for them to feel happy and content; it shouldn’t take much for us, either.
<br/>
- **No overthinking**
  They don’t complicate their lives with overthinking. It's like they have cracked the code that overthinking doesn't lead to anything good. Why do we tend to overcomplicate everything in our lives?
  <br/>
- **Masters of solitude**
  They are good at handling boredom and staying with themselves. Something we have lost to the modern world! When was the last time you sat with yourself and did nothing? Give it a try; you might find a new person within you.
  <br/>
- **Quick to forgive**
  They don’t hold grudges. 
  They do something stupid; you get mad at them, they get bit scared. But they will quietly sneak into your lap after few minutes. Matter resolved!
  Almost a zen-like quality that we can learn from them.
  <br/>
- **Unmatched excitement**
  They are the most excited to see you when you are coming home. Every single time, without a fail!
  This sense of excitement on little things and appreciation of what you have got, something we can learn from these voiceless creatures.
  <br/> 
- **Make you move**
  They help you move. Yes, you have to take your dog out for some physical work, good for them and good for you. Maybe, maybe you can reach your daily steps goal in the process. 
  <br/>
- **What you see is what you get**
  I haven't seen dogs pretending to be someone they are not. They are what they are. They emote how they feel. You can see through them.
  I understand we can't always be like that, but what if we try a little bit more to be ourselves and more authentic?



So, wouldn't incorporating or amplifying these dog-like qualities enhance your daily life? It has certainly helped me. You be the judge of it.

Until next time.
