Title: About Me
---
My name is Sanjay Bhagia and I am based in Sydney, Australia. I'm working at [Inauro](https://www.inauro.io) as a Cloud Solutions Architect & Developer. Here, I'm helping Inauro build an IoT (Internet of Things) Saas Platform called [Perspio](www.perspio.io).

I'm also a published author. You can check my course on [Cloud Computing Fundamentals](https://www.educative.io/courses/cloud-computing-fundamentals) over at [Educative](https://www.educative.io/)

I'm focused on Cloud development with emphasis on developing quality solutions by leveraging the power of cloud and software craftsmanship. I love to get the overall view of the problem space and leverage the best tools and technologies available to solve business needs. I like to think of software as a living organism and hence try to create solutions and softwares that are agile and evolving.

I am quite interested in exploring latest developments in technology and try to keep myself updated. Iâ€™m a foodie and love watching movies, love to read books and travel around the world whenever I can.
